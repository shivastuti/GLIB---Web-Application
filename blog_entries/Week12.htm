<p>I am really struggling a lot with the database issues.Created the design of my homepage today.<p>
<p> Things to do list</p>
<ul><li>Complete the css and layout of the website</li>
<li>Incorporate the api fetching codes into the project code from the experiments</li>
<li>Troubleshoot the database connectivity issue</li>
</ul>
<p>The work is progressing at a good pace and since things were well-planned i have been able to implement features on time.The delay is caused by the technical issues in the server</p>
