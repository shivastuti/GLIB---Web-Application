<p>This week has been full of a lot of technical issues.The major problem that I faced was a very trivial one but problem nonetheless.I have been unable to create roles on the server.
It seems that such an issue occurs in every batch with a few students.Anyway I will try to fix the issue from my end.
Also the api for retrieving journals is giving a few issues because of the cross-domain fetching of data.
I created a web method to retrieve the stringified dataset.Also implemented the autosearch feature to retrieve results while the user types the search term.
</p>
<p>Hoping to finish the functionality this week</p>
