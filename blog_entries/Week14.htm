<p>Problems all the more.Lost all my data from the main folder on the system due to a virus and realised that I had commited the same folder to the server so lost all the data from the server as well.
Have been trying to salvage as much as is possible to.Have thought of implementing facebook login as suggested by a peer since normal login has not been feasible.I have been able to achieve most of what was planned in the wireframes but since I had defined a huge scope,it seems that not all the functionalities could be incorporated in such a short tenure.As pointed out by Prof Jose this really had been an ambitious design.
