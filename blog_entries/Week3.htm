<p>
By the end of this week,I resolved all the issues that occured at the site like the animation not rendering correctly,the code snippets not included in the experiments and faulty positioning.</p>
<p>Goals achieved this week:<br>
<ol><li>Resolved issues from past weel</li><li>Downloaded bootstrap</li>
<li>Created first set of experiements for responsive layout</li><li>Applied responsive layout on the Home Page</li> <li>Finally thought of a project topic-Phew!!!</li>
</ol><br>
My project would be a Global Library system where in people could search for paperbacks online and the result would be geographical locations of all the libraries that house the book.Many other features would be included like finding the nearest library,browsing the library website and placing orders for borrowing,returning or even donating books to a library.The idea is to create an application that makes libraries accessible for the booklovers like me who still prefer the smell of old library books than the flashy gadgets which allow you to scroll down the page rather than browse through the look and feel of a book.<br>
My goals for the next week:<ul><li>Creating aspx pages using bootstrap</li>
<li>Designing experiements for generating basic layout of a library portal</li><li>Finishing off the responsive set of experiments</li><li>Fixing all bugs related to responsiveness</li></ul></p>
