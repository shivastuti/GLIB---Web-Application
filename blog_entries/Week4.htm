<p>
By the end of this week,I was able to achieve the following goals:<ul><li>Implement an experiment that included bootstrap and thus incorporated the responsiveness of webpages using the tool.</li>
<li>Created the outline of what my project would look like</li><li> Found an API - European Library that can be used for database requirements for my project.</li></ul></p>
<p>Programmable web proved to be useful in this search.Although I have to look for backups as well.So from the goal set that I created last week I was able to implement the three goals of creating aspx,using bootstrap and implementing responsiveness.However since I penned down the outline of the look of the webpages,I think I would have to delay the list of experiments that I need to create these.</p><p>
My goals for this week would include:<ul><li>Preparing the requirement analysis and design layout for my site and uploading it in a separate section on the site</li>
<li>Creating a few experiments for filling out forms and searching using google.I believe this would definitely be a major part of my project so this experiment should be the first among the list that I can come up with</li><li>Also,I would incorporate the responsiveness on the home page using Bootstrap tool now replacing the conventional way.</li>
</ul>
