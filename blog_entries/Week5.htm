Week4 and started to rush into troubles with the major experiments.
Created the quintessential experiment for searching information and retrieving it from an API into my webpage.
The prototype seems to have come along but still need to fix a few essential details and need to define the scope of my project as well.
Following things were taken care of during this week:
<br>
<ul><li>Created experiment for webservices usage
</li><li>Learnt about using java script and ajax in aspx page</li></ul>
<p>
The downside faced was that the rendering encoutered a bug for which I was unable to find a fix.Aim to fix it as soon as possible.Need to speed up things and finish off with the two tasks that were defined last week.</p>
