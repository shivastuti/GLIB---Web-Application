<h2>
Week5</h2>
<p>Finally was able to work on something substantial this week.I discovered an amazing site that helped me to keep track of the number of page hits i.e number of unique visitors to my site.Incorporated that for sure in my experiment since it will be a trivial but not unimportant part of my project.
The site was <a href=
"http://www.e-zeeinternet.com/setup.php">www.zeeinternet.com</a>.Also,implemented a very important feature in my experiment,using Google maps.I intend to further this experiment to display the result set from my restful API to generating the directions/navigation map for the desired location that the customer picks.
Following things were taken care of during this week:
<br>
<ul><li>Created experiment for Google maps and Page hits
</li><li>Finally implemented Bootstrap on the HomePage</li></ul>
<p>
I fixed the bugs that occured last week and the wireframe of the project is in progress.The inputs by Prof Jose regarding wireframing the project turned out to be quite useful.I think it is a better approach than just jumping on to the Design document.
</p><p>The goals for weeks to follow are as follows:</p><ul><li>Upload the wireframe document</li><li>Create the continuation experiment for Google Search</li><li>Create Event Handling,Image slideshow and JQuery experiments for draggable,sortable.The latter half of the target list is more so for learning purpose</li></ul>
