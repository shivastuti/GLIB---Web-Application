<h2>Week 6 </h2>
This week has been mainly research and experimentation with the Google API
 and the Programmable Web API that I had finalised for the project.The api experimentation was mainly carried out on the website
<a href="https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/library/m/books/v1/books.volumes.list?q=shakespere&_h=1&">
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/library/m/books/v1/books.volumes.list?q=shakespere&_h=1&</a>.Following tasks were accomplished this week:<br><ul><li>Correction of previous codes i.e. incorporation of inline c# code in all files and removal of Cs files from the folders.</li><li>Creation and upload of the Wireframe for the main page in the Design Tab on the Home Page</li><li>Testing of data retrieval on the Google API and implemented a trivial experiment to check that the retrieval using key is working fine.</li></ul><p>
The goals set for this week were met,but only the ground work has been laid out.The tasks for the coming weeks are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Uploading all wireframes for all pages so that my target for the project is known</li><li>Creating a set of experiments for all kinds of data retrieval feasible from the project application</li><li>Creating the Home Page of the application</li></ul><br>
<p>My main intention is to come up with a single-page application which is easy to deploy and handle.The final product would be converted into a mobile app which can be used to track nearest libraries with books available.Would have to test the feasibility very soon so that I can determine the tradeoffs and the expanse of the project.This would be estimated by all kinds of retrieval experiments fromthe API</p>
