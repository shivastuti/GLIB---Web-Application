<h2>Week 8 </h2><p>
This week has been updates to the Design tab of the Website.I have created and uploaded the wireframes of the 
project layout.During the process I also use cases and have created detailed wireframes including the use-cases and
this process helped me in identifying the tables for the project as well.I created the database on the local system with 
nine tables with raw data.
The tasks for the coming weeks are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Next week would be data connectivity experiments for the local database
                                 </li><li>Creating the Home Page of the application</li></ul><br>
<p>My main focus during the coming week would be on implementing the site layout and on the sidelines creating the 
    experiments for different data retrieval process for my project.
    I found the most suitable API for my project recently and on weighing the pros and cons of the previously chosen APIs
    I found worldcat to be the best.Guess,I would be going forth with it in the implementation.
