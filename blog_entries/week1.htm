<h1>My Web Dev Pursuits</h1>
<p>It has been a great week for me brushing up HTML and css and finally starting to work on something that I have been yearning to do.It took me a couple of days to revise the tags and code a few elaborate programs on the tutorial site <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_id_class.asp"> http://www.w3schools.com </a>.I also used the background from a site that offers free backgrounds <a href="http://iloveitblogdesigns.blogspot.com/2011/08/vintage-and-antique-inspired-by-dearest.html"> http://iloveitblogdesigns.blogspot.com </a>.My first set of experiments was designed to take a peek into the animation aspects of texts and images.I could cover the following topics in this set:</p><ol>
<li>Using the box-shadow property in animation</li>
<li>Generating series of Images using the hover animation</li>
<li>Performing animation on text for mouse hovering </li>
<li>Creating a navigation bar</li></ol>
<p>I have managed to get an idea about how the creation of a navigation bar works.I made use of a few online sources to get an idea bout the look and feel of the apple navigation bar.</p>
<p>I encountered a few problems as well:<ul><li>I noticed that experiments got cluttered when the css was embedded in the html code.</li>
<li>I encountered a few issues in separating the css code from the html which resulted in some errors.</li></ul><p>
I created a layout of the homepage with separate html and css files.
However this layout is experimental and I do not intend to make use of this layout completely since it is not completely original and for the learning purpose, I implemented a navigation tool bar that already exists.I took help from this tutorial <a href="http://www.threestyles.com/tutorials/coding-apples-navigation-bar-using-css-sprites/"> www.threestyles.com </a>

</p><h2>Plan of action</h2>
<ul><li>Creating separate css and html for experiments going forth</li>
<li>Coming up with the project topic so that I can create relevant experiments</li><li>Implementing functionalities using bootstrap for the next set of problems</li><li>Most importantly I would be experimenting with the responsive layout of the site</li></ul>
