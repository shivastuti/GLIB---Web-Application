          I am an avid reader and books have been fascinating me since early childhood days.For me the most beautiful part memories of my childhood comprise of the introduction to fairytales,story books,picture books and magazines like the Reader's digest.
            The idea of GLIB (Global library) came to me when we had to come nup with a project plan for Web Development course.The main intention was to build a comkprehensive site which caters to all needs of book lovers around the globe.
            <br />
            My intention was to build a book and journal search website where a person could post comments and read recommendations for new books.
            GLIB has been a journey of creating a beautiful interface with responsive features and a smooth transitioning from page to page.
