The advent of computing technology has led to more and more systems being 
controlled by computers and not by people.  Computers are supposed to enhance
systems by being completely logical and doing exactly what they are told to
do.  The idea of a computer controlled system is very idyllic as a computer is
supposed to be much more reliable than a person and less prone to mistakes.  
Computers do, for the most part, act out of total logic and do exactly what
they are told to do except they suffer from a fatal error.  Computer programs
are written by humans who are definitely prone to mistakes.

The term Computer used to mean a person who would do arithmetic equations
but between 1935 and 1945 it began to refer to a machine.  The human brain
was replaced by a computer's ability to store and process information.
Computing technology was a huge step forward for processing information in 
many ways but it also led to some major drawbacks.  The earliest computers
were much simpler than the ones we have today even though they were much
larger.  Any error given by the machine could be located quickly in its
simple framework.  The earliest software errors were also fairly minor
because computers were not integrated so heavily into activities.  In the
1940s, the computers Colossus and ENIAC were mostly used to simply crunch
numbers at an accelerated rate so there was not much room to make giant errors
when the output could be instantly verified or unverified.  Even though it 
was not technically a software error, the term computer bug came from naval
officer Grace Hopper when a moth was found inside a computer's internal
components causing errors.  It wasn't until the 1960s that software errors 
became very relevant and harder to find before they appeared first hand.

On July 22nd, 1962 the NASA Mariner 1 probe was destroyed 293 seconds after
launch by the range safety officer after it veered off course.  This was due 
in large part to software errors.  One was the misuse of airborne beacon 
equipment and the other was the omission of a hyphen in the code for the probe.
It is surprising that a single hyphen could lead to the destruction of large 
amounts of money in an invested asset but that is the drawback of the computer
era.  Even more than 20 years ago software errors were causing very large
problems in the systems operated by computers.  In 1963 a NORAD training
exercise was brought to a halt because of a software error caused by faulty
pathing of radar information.  The cold war was an arms race in military 
technology and nuclear power but also in computational power.  More and more
military applications would be brought under computer control in order to have
an edge over the opposition.  However this meant a computer error could have
greater and greater impact on the lives of millions of people.  In the 1960s
an error in an aircraft design program contributed to several serious crashes.
Software errors continued through the decades to be just as prevalent if not 
more than in decades past.  In 1977, the Worldwide Military Command and Control
System had only a 38 percent success rate in message transmission during an 
exercise.  In fact there were a number of times in which the cold war almost 
went live due to software malfunctions or errors.  However due to the
reservation of people on both sides the errors were double checked and luckily
war did not start.  However this goes to show how quickly software errors began
to affect the entire world.  From the creation of electric computers in the 
30s and 40s to their controlling entire military forces in the span of only
30 years.  It would seem almost reckless to put computers in charge of so much
but there is really no telling if humans would do a better or worse job.  The
continuation of using computers so prevalently is that they can accomplish so
much more, so much faster than people so the price of any malfunctions is 
generally seen as a minor cost.

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology in a 2002
report, software errors cost the U.S. economy 59.5 billion dollars every year.
Though that number was from over 10 years ago I would not be surprised if it 
was even higher today.  The U.S. is a large innovator in new technology but
other countries are quickly following suit and becoming more and more computer
oriented. We live in a digital age where nearly every thing we
do is regulated by computers.  The roads we drive on are controlled by software
encoded street lights.  The classes we take take place on computers more and
more every year.  Most everyone carries around a small computer in their
pocket to help them navigate through the day.  Computers and software have
become so engrained in our daily lives it is hard to imagine a world without
them.

The quote alludes to the fact that most of our society is completely merged
with computers so a software error can be devastating on most everyone since
we are all connected by technology.  If an error occurred in a digitized power
plant then cities could be without power for weeks.  A glitch in the stock
market could put millions of people in debt.  A navigation error on an aircraft
could kill everyone on board.  These sounds like nightmarish events but they
do happen and in all likelyhood will happen again.  In 1994 a Chinook
helicopter crashed killing 29 people.  At first it was believed to be the 
pilot's fault but later after an investigation, the on board computer was 
found to have faults in it.  Before the turn of the millennium it was widely
believed that when computers had their clocks turn to the year 2000 they would
crash causing world wide devastation as every computer crashed.  This led to
panic about the end of the civilized world but it ended up with programmers
providing last minute fixes.

As computers start to take charge of more and more parts of the daily lives of
people they will lead to their errors being more and more dangerous.  It is
becoming extremely important for programmers to make sure their code works
before it is unleashed upon millions of people.  The quote had a lot of truth
to it but the change was very rapid from when the first computers were made
to when they affected the lives of millions of people.  In the years to come
they will continue to do so.
